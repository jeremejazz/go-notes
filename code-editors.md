# Code Editors for Go Programming

You're arsenal available at your disposal. The following are some free editors used.

## Sublime

Commercial yet still free to use text editor. If you don't like the popup message from time to time you can purchase a license.

#### Recommended Plugins

* GoSublime - TBA

## Atom

An good alternative to sublime. Some of it's key mapping was adapted. Also includes some useful plugins

#### Recommended Plugins

* GoPlus - TBA \(needs checking\)

## Visual Studio Code

A remarcable code Editor by Microsoft made from Atom's engine Electron. 

#### Recommended Plugin

* [Go](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)

## Vim / Neovim

If you're comfortable with this it means you're hard core. Lightweight yet powerful. On the other hand neovim is simply just an improvement for vim. Personally I use neovim since there are some additional features such as easier command mode and some plugins.

#### Recommended Plugins:

* [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) - Includes auto formatting, running code in the editor, and auto generation of code when creating a new file in Go.
* [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) Batteries included that's kinda large for download.  
* [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) Autocompletion for neovim users
