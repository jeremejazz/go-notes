# Go Programming Notebook

These are my notes where I put everything I learn from the Go Programming language. This never fails to surprise me. 

I will be including source codes and explanations as well. This is not a beginners book but more like a notebook when I try to scribble what I learn from online courses, documentations, other sample codes, etc.
