Go provides a rich source of documentation  


- [Go Docs](https://golang.org/doc/) - Probably the Best place to start for learning the Go Programming languge. Ebooks are also good though but this is a good place to start. 

    - [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) - A codeacademy-ish where you can get your hands a bit dirty (compiling on your own machine is still *dirtier*). This web application also be installed offline.
